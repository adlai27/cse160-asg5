Extra: Shadows
Extra: Fog
Extra: Mini-map of overhead and able to switch cameras, press 2 to switch to overhead and 1 to switch back
Extra: Billboard labeling for 3D objects

For animation: The 20 objects in a ring are animating by swaying and moving back and forth, as if floating in the water, There are also sphere bubbles floating up. 

Used .obj and .mtl for the treasure and ship 3d objects, and .glb for my fish. 
The textures on the object shapes scattered around the floor is to mimic textures found underwater, like coral, seaweed, stones, etc.
